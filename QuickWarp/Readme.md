## Installation

1. Install **BepInEx**: [https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)  
2. Download this mod.
3. Unzip the content into the game‚Äôs root folder (the same place where the `.exe` is located).
   - The file structure should look like:
     ```
     <GameFolder>/
       BepInEx/
         plugins/
           QuickWarp/
             QuickWarp.dll
     ```

## Configuration
After opening the game at least one time, a configuration file is generated in `<GameFolder>/BepInEx/config`:
- QuickWarp.cfg
```
saveWarpKey = <Key1>
loadWarpKey = <Key2>
```
By default, we use F6/F7. But you can set whatever unity keycode you want (check the name in the [link](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html))


## Usage

- **Save a waypoint:** Press **F6**  
- **Load a waypoint:** Press **F7**

### Examples
- Save the game, press **F6**, and when you load the game again (bench respawn), press **F7** to teleport back to your last position.
- Save right in front of a boss so if you die you can skip the walk back.
- Practice or train tricky sections quickly.
- Etc.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

This mod does **not** save or restore the game state ‚Äî it only moves your character‚Äôs position and load a scene if necessary. 

Some behaviors may break the game logic:

- Saving in the middle of a boss fight ‚Üí Undefined behavior (boss fight may not trigger properly when you warp back).
- Other scripted events may also desync.

üëâ **Use at your own risk.**
