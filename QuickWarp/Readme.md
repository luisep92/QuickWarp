## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

This mod does **not** save or restore the game state ‚Äî it only moves your character‚Äôs position.  
Some behaviors may break the game logic:

- Sitting on a bench and pressing **F7** ‚Üí You will float (since sitting disables normal physics).
- Saving in the middle of a boss fight ‚Üí Undefined behavior (boss fight may not trigger properly when you warp back).
- Other scripted events may also desync.

üëâ **Use at your own risk.**
